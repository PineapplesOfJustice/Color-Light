      <h3><i>The Electromagnetic Spectrum:</i></h3>
      <p>Our main source of light arrive from a star known as the Sun. Each photon, or the elemental particles of electromagnetics energy, can be splitted into a wide range of sectors. Discovered in parts by numerous figures, the electromagntic spectrum showed different parts of a photon. Between the 400-700 nanometer wavelength are the visible light and will be our main topic. These are what we perceived as light in everyday life. As Issac Newton had discovered, visible light can be slit using a prism. About 700 nanometer wide is the color red. On the other end is the color purple at about 400 nanometer wide. And if you haven't noticed, these are the seven colors of the rainbow because humidity could act as a prism also. </p>

      <h3><i>How It Apply:</i></h3>
      <p>Under normal circumstances, we can only see the visible light sector of the electromagnetic spectrum. White light, as it is also called, can be absorbed, transmitted, and/or reflected. The absorbtion of some and reflection of others allowed us to perceive individual color. Let's say Alexander is wearing a true-blue penguin t-shirt. This meant all color were absorbed beside blue, which is reflected when white light is shining. A white shirt will reflect all color light, hence the name white light. White is the embodiment of all color. Black on the other hand is the absence of all color. When white light is shine on a black shirt, all color light are absorbed leaving our brain to perceived it as black.</p>
