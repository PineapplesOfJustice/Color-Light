<h3><i>Absorption, Reflection, and Transmission:</i></h3>
<p>Light waves have frequencies and so do molecules. Their electrons are like smoothie blenders waiting to be turn on. Each molecules have a different natural frequency needed to begin their vibration. When light waves with the same frequency struck, the electrons vibrate in respond and turn it into thermal energy. The light absorbed to be never seen again. When strucked by light waves of the wrong frequencies, one of two things can happen. For a colored object, the electrons will vibrate shortly and remit the light waves out. This is what we call a reflection. When light waves are transmitted across the object, we call it a transmission. In such cases, the object appear translucent and see-through. We could think of absorption as a black hole, stealing the light. Reflection as a mirror and transmission as a window, letting light in, letting it out.</p>

<h3><i>Scatter!</i></h3>
<p>Sunlight came a long way from the sun to reach the Earth. When passing through the atmosphere, the photons must pass through layers of nitrogen and oxygen. These gases are excellence at scattering high frequency light waves, most notably, blue and violet. It do this through reflection, or absorbing and remitting light. Because our eyes are better at picking up blue than violet, this also explain why we perceive the sky as blue! Also, in the world of light, red plus green make yellow and this is why the sun is yellow. Throughout the day, the sun move from east to west and eventually approach sunset. What had caused the sun to change from yellow to orange? The answer lies in distance. During noon, the sun take a direct path and not much green light is scattered. However, by the time sunset come, the sun is far, far away. By this time, we can barely see blue and following the order of violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, green is next on the line to be scattered. So mixing red and a little bit of green, we get orange!</p>
