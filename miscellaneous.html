    <div id="P1">
      <h3><u><i>Facts:</i></u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To us, light is truly invisible, unless it hit a cloud of particles or get reflect off of a hard object.</li>
        <li>Light can be absorped, reflected, and/or transmitted according to the vibration frequency of the electrons.</li>
        <li>Light is what we perceived as colors.</li>
        <li>Using a prism, light can be splitted into seven colors and observed. These colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.</li>
        <li>These colors each have their own frequency with red as the lowest and violet as the highest.</li>
        <li>White is all the colors, whereas black is nothing. This is because black absorped all of the colors so our eyes can't pick up light.</li>
        <li>Visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. </li>
        <li>Visible light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can perceived.</li>
        <li>Each type of elements have a tendency to absorp a specific wavelength. </li>
        <li>Light don't stop, it keep going on for eternity until it is absorped and converted into heat energy.</li>
        <li>We have three type of cone cells in our eyes which perceived a different range of frequency each.</li>
        <li>The electromagnetic spectrum was named for its electric-like and magnetic-like properties.</li>
        <li>Light move as a wave-particle duality.</li>
        <li>Light is still clouded with mysteries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><u><i>Questions for Further Research:</i></u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How does light really work? As a wave, particle, or wave-particles duality?</li>
        <li>What are the forbidden-color? Who experimented on them and what were the result.</li>
        <li>If red and green make yellow, how do we see brown?</li>
        <li>Different people perceived things differently. How can we explain light or color?</li>
        <li>How will a banana look through a green light filter? Green? Blue?</li>
      </ul>
