      <h3><i>Color Addition:</i></h3>
      <p>When thinking of white light, we automatically refer to the colors of the rainsbow, but that isn't the only combination to form white light. Color addition mean we can combine any three distinct color lights with different intensity to form the other colors! These distinct colors are what we called the primary color of light. There are many variation, but the main one is red, green, and blue. This is also the very same combination we perceived with our eyes! In our retinas, there are three kind of cone cells, one for red, one for blue, and one for green. In equal intesity, red plus green make yellow, red plus blue make magenta, and green plus blue make cyan! These are what we call the secondary colors of light and naturally, if you shine red, green, and blue together, you get white light! Any other colors we perceive can be formed by a specific combination and intensity of those three plus black and grey.

      <h3><i>Complementary Colors of Light:</i></h3>
      <p>Any two colors light that can be combines to form white light are known as the complementary colors of light. These colors generally involve a primary and a secondary color of light. For example, we can shine red and cyan together and form white light! Why? Cyan is a mixture of green and blue. This mean that when we shine red and cyan together, it is actually red, blue, and green! As you may have noticed red and cyan are actually directly across each other. This is also true for green-magenta and blue-yellow, since magenta is red plus blue and yellow is red plus green. So yeah, this is it, but you could try this little interaction though.<a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Light-and-Color/Stage-Lighting/Stage-Lighting-Interactive" style="color:black">Stage Lighting-Physic Classroom</a>.</p>
